            <p> <strong>Description:</strong> We are all stardust and stories... When Zachary Rawlins stumbles across a mysterious book containing details from his own life among its pages, it leads him on a quest unlike any other. 
                Following the clues inside, he is guided to a masquerade ball, a dangerous secret club, and finally to an ancient library hidden far beneath the surface of the earth.
                What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians - it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. 
                But when the library is threatened, Zachary must race through its twisting tunnels and sweetly soaked shores, searching for the end of his story.</p>
